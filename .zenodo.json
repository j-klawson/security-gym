  "title": "Security Gym: Gymnasium Environments for Cybersecurity Threat Detection with Continual Learning",
  "description": "Gymnasium-compatible environment that replays labeled Linux log streams for continual learning research. Scripted attacks mixed with real server traffic produce ground-truth-labeled data with multi-head prediction targets. Built for the Alberta Plan vision of long-lived agents that continually learn from non-stationary sensory streams.",
