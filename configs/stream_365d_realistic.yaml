# 365-day realistic internet-facing server — primary experiment stream
#
# Models a year of traffic on a typical internet-facing Linux server.
# Attack distribution reflects real-world prevalence:
#   - Port scans and SSH brute force dominate (constant background noise)
#   - Credential stuffing is common (breach dump reuse)
#   - Web exploits are targeted but less frequent
#   - Post-auth execution is rare (most attacks fail at initial access)
#
# At 2.5 campaigns/day, this produces ~912 attack campaigns across
# the year — enough non-stationarity for continual learning while
# maintaining realistic benign-to-malicious ratios.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m attacks compose configs/stream_365d_realistic.yaml
#   python -m attacks compose configs/stream_365d_realistic.yaml --dry-run

    # Distribution based on real-world attack prevalence:
    #   - Recon/scans: most common, constant background noise
    #   - Brute force: dominant SSH attack pattern
    #   - Credential stuffing: growing with breach dump availability
    #   - Web exploits: targeted, requires specific vulnerabilities
    #   - Execution: rare, only when attacker gains valid credentials
    distribution:
      discovery: 0.30           # TA0007 — port scans, service enumeration
      brute_force: 0.30         # TA0006 — SSH password guessing
      credential_stuffing: 0.20 # TA0006 — breach dump credential reuse
      web_exploit: 0.15         # TA0001 — Log4Shell, known CVEs
      execution: 0.05           # TA0002 — post-auth (rare success)
