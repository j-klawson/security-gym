# 90-day mixed stream — full experiment composition
#
# Produces a continuous log stream with benign server activity interspersed
# with Poisson-scheduled attack campaigns, weighted by MITRE ATT&CK tactics.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m attacks compose configs/stream_90d_mixed.yaml
#   python -m attacks compose configs/stream_90d_mixed.yaml --dry-run

stream:
  duration: 90d
  seed: 42

  benign:
    db: ../data/benign.db            # Hopper server logs — cycled to fill duration

  attacks:
    db: ../data/campaigns.db         # Attack event templates from Isildur campaigns

    # Poisson process rate for campaign scheduling
    campaigns_per_day: 3.0

    # MITRE ATT&CK-aligned attack type weights (normalized to probabilities)
    distribution:
      discovery: 0.35             # TA0007 / T1046 — port scans, network recon
      brute_force: 0.30           # TA0006 / T1110.001 — SSH credential brute force
      web_exploit: 0.20           # TA0001 / T1190 — Log4Shell exploitation
      credential_stuffing: 0.10   # TA0006 / T1110.004 — credential stuffing
      execution: 0.05             # TA0002 / T1059 — command execution

  output:
    db: ../data/exp01_90d.db
